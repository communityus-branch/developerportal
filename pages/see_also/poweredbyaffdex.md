Nevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced adventure thriller game that takes you into the darkly surreal world of the subconscious.

As you explore the abstract world within the minds of trauma victims and solve the cryptic puzzles lurking within, a biofeedback technology monitors your moment-to-moment anxiety. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game will become harder. If you’re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.  

Nevermind strives to create a haunting gameplay experience that also teaches you how to be more aware of your internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your anxiety within the intense realm of Nevermind, imagine what you will be able to do when faced with stressful moments in the real world…  

Nevermind explores themes of psychological trauma and PTSD and seeks to not only engage, but to also educate players about trauma and potentially become a tool that may be used within a therapeutic context.

<br />
You have lost the love of your life. Overwhelmed by grief, you sit by her tomb, flipping through the pages of the journal that chronicles your life together. So begins SYNC, an interactive visual novel designed in Unity using emotion recognition software from Affectiva.  You assume the role of Alex, grieving the recent death of her lover, Ivy, in a car crash. Unable to move on, Alex can’t help but futilely imagine what she might done differently to prevent the fateful accident. Players advance the narrative by syncing their facial expressions with those of Alex. Eventually, Alex (and through her, the player) is faced with a choice: to accept her doomed relationship so she can begin to move on, or to reject her relationship and remain trapped in the past.

SYNC won the "Excellence in Innovative Narrative" award at [RPI](http://rpi.edu)'s 2016 gamefest.  You can download it from [itch.io](https://keyboardkommander.itch.io/sync-since-you-never-came).

Doors is a demo with the intent of showing game developers how a player’s emotions could change a game accordingly, making the game more immersive. By using a webcam and Affectiva’s SDK, the demo allows players to open doors based strictly on their emotions. The implication is made that it is possible for a player to go even further, manipulating major aspects of the game using emotional input.
