#### How do we map facial expressions to emotions?

The Emotion predictors use the observed facial expressions as input to calculate the likelihood of an emotion. Our Facial expression to emotion mapping builds on EMFACS mappings developed by [Friesen & Ekman](http://www.paulekman.com/product-category/facs/). A facial expression can have either a positive or a negative effect on the likelihood of an emotion. The following table shows the relationship between the facial expressions and the emotions predictors.
